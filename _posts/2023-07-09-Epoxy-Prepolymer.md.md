Epoxy resins have a wide range of applications, especially in the construction industry. The system usually contains two components which are Epoxy resin and an amine hardener; however, there might be some problems in these systems such as overheating and shrinkage which affects the final mechanical properties.<br>
In this project, we use Diethanol amine (which produce in Iran) as a harder which is pre-polymerized partially with epoxy resin. Therefore, this new amine releases less heat and shrinkage during the curing process and can be added to other hardeners.
