Economics and engineering design was one the most usable courses in my BSc. Dr. Sotoudeh was our professor and we had to study a specific material production process.
During that time, I was working in Padrapat and no polyamine is produced in Iran so I decided to choose DETA (Diethylenetriamine) which is a common epoxy hardener for this study.<br>
Market research had done and we found there is a good market available in Iran. Studying production processes and economics analysis led us to find there is a large amount of product is needed to achieve a head-to-head point in 5 years. This amount is more than domestic consumption and needs to be exported. Due to sanctions, export might be very difficult and this plan is not efficient.<br>

Besides this project, we had an interview with many industrial managers and we learned a lot of soft skills from their experience and goals.
