Latex is a dispersion of polymer into water. The main characteristic of latex is its film formation which is done in a 3-step coalescing. <br>

Coalescing agents reduce MFT and help film forming. Meanwhile, there are a lot of coalescing agents such as Texanol and they can be used for different latexes. Also, the Hansen solubility parameter divides solubility into three terms which are based on molecular forces: Hydrogen forces, Polar forces, and dispersive forces. Every ingredient has its own HSP terms and the distance between two components on HSP coordination (RED) can determine their miscibility. <br>

This project focuses on the solubility parameter of latex and coalescing agent in order to improve film formation with the RED of two components. I worked on proposals and review related articles on this project during 1 year of my MSc at the Amirkabir University of Technology under the supervision of <a href=" https://aut.ac.ir/cv/2327/Seyed%20MOHSEN%20MOHSENI"> Dr. Mohseni</a>.
