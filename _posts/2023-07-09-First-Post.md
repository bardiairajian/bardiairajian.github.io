Hello and welcome to my website.<br>
Writing in weblogs has been a hobby for me since childhood and I enjoy writing weblogs to share my ideas and knowledge. 
Meanwhile, with the development of social networks such as Facebook, Telegram, and Whatsapp weblogs start to disappear and most of the content was 
shared on social media.
The main problem with this situation is its accessibility. You cannot search on Google to find your content and it should be done in the application platform which 
usually didn't work properly.<br>
I create this website to talk about my projects, my ideas, or somehow my memories. Thank you for reading and I hope you enjoy the website. If there are any
question please don't hesitate to ask me with the email or phone number which you can find here.
